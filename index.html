    The Greek essayist Plutarch describes Spartacus as "a Thracian of Nomadic stock",[3] in a possible reference to the Maedi tribe.[4] Appian says he was "a Thracian by birth,
    who had once served as a soldier with the Romans, but had since been a prisoner and sold for a gladiator

        "This rebellion, interpreted by some as an example of oppressed people fighting for their freedom against a slave-owning oligarchy,
         has provided inspiration for many political thinkers,
         and has been featured in literature, television, and film.[1]
          Although this interpretation is not specifically contradicted by classical historians,
           no historical account mentions that the goal was to end slavery in the Republic"
